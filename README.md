## Installation - for all
To run the server or the clients you need to copy the root file 
`config.example.json` as `config.json` and change at least the host
of where the server will be running and optionally the port numbers of
the server and clients.
The clients will use the configured server host and port to connect
with the server's websocket communication channel.
